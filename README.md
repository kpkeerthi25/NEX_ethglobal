# Description
  NEX is a trustless NFT-to-NFT exchange, here two people can exchange thier NFTs without any hindrances.
  
# Problem Statement
  Exchanging NFT to another NFT is a huge problem now. There are currently only two options but both have thier own downsides.
  
  1. List in a marketplace: There is a hugh possibility that someone else could buy it or the intended person may not have enough crypto to make this happen.
  2. Blind-Trust: Sending the NFT to other person, trusting that he/she will pay you back. (Stupid option xD)
